# Rocket Launch
This program uses simple base level physics to create plots based off acceleration and time elapsed. Please take not that 1 second in the simulation is not equal to 1 second in real life.In consequence, some of the plots might seem accelerated.

# Dependancies
Matplotlib
Numpy
Tkinter

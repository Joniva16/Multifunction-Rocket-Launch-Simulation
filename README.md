This program uses simple base level physics to create plots based off acceleration and time elapsed. Please take not that 1 second in the simulation is not equal to 1 second in real life so in consequence some of the plots might seem accelerated. For this specfic project I used matplotlib simple plots and scatter plots as well as a heatmap.
